This error occurs when you are trying to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is a common issue in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when component state hasn't been properly initialized.

```javascript
// Example causing the error
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUserData().then(setUserData);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{userData.name}</Text> {/* Error here if userData is still null */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
